# Twibbon Rodja - Idul Fitri Greeting Card Generator

## Overview
Twibbon Rodja is a simple web-based application that allows users to generate personalized Idul Fitri greeting cards. Users can input their name, and the application will render a custom flyer with their name centered on a festive Idul Fitri background. The generated image can be downloaded or shared directly.

## Features
- **Custom Name Input:** Users can personalize the card with their name.
- **Auto-Centering Text:** Ensures that the text is properly aligned within the design.
- **Text Wrapping Support:** Handles long names gracefully by breaking them into multiple lines.
- **Live Preview:** The flyer is generated dynamically on a canvas element.
- **Download & Share:** Users can download the final image or share it directly using the Web Share.
